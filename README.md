It is an online internship task organised by TSF GRIP.
As a data analyst, I was tasked with performing ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’ to identify the weak areas of the business where improvements could be made to increase profitability.

To begin the analysis, I first gathered the dataset and imported it into the Power BI tool. I then created a dashboard with visualizations that displayed the key measures of the business, such as profit, sales, discount, and quantity. These measures were analyzed based on various categories such as sub-category, state, city, and shipping mode to gain insights into the performance of different segments of the business.

The visualizations in the dashboard allowed me to quickly identify the top-performing states and products, as well as the weak areas that require improvement. Specifically, I used the dashboard to identify the five weakest market states where the company should focus its efforts to improve sales and profitability. I also identified the bottom five weakest products that require attention from the business managers.

The dashboard provided a comprehensive view of the business's performance, enabling me to uncover patterns and trends in the data that would otherwise be difficult to detect. I used this information to create a report that summarized my findings and provided recommendations for improving the business's performance.

Overall, the analysis provided valuable insights into the business's performance and highlighted areas where improvements could be made to increase profitability. By utilizing the Power BI dashboard, I was able to easily identify the weak areas of the business and provide actionable recommendations to help the company grow and succeed.
